An advanced, easy to setup, free, and unbranded Discord-Roblox ranking bot. With powerful features and modular infrastructure, Qbot is the last bot you'll ever need to manage your group.

## Installation
Setup instructions are available at https://docs.lengolabs.com/qbot/setup. This project can be hosted on shared hosts, such as Replit, as well as any Linux distribution that supports Node.js v16 or higher.

If you run into any problems while configuring Qbot, please do not hesitate to join our [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/GkUNhZmenn)! Our volunteer support team is happy to assist you to make sure that you have the best experience possible, and that the setup process goes smoothly.

## License
We use the MIT License, due to its permissive structure and the piece of mind it provides for contributors. We highly recommend you read the license before maintaining this project, so you have an idea of what is allowed, and what is not allowed.

> You can read the license here: https://github.com/yogurtsyum/qbot/blob/master/LICENSE  

## Note on Discord API
Please note that the Discord has separate terms of conditions for bots running on Discord's API. Please review that here before installing the bot: https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal

Specifically, this is something very relevant to hosting Qbot:

> You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information ("PII"). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your application that uses the API (your “API Client”) that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Discord and third parties. ([jump to section](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal#a-implement-good-privacy-practices))

It is your responsibility to implement a privacy policy, as mentioned in this quote from the API above. We recommend you join the [Discord Developers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) server if you have any questions about this policy.

## Have feedback? Suggestions?

## Contributing
First of all, thank you for looking into contributing to Qbot! We greatly appreciate all pull requests and issues, as they help us provide a better experience to the thousands of Qbot users. We recommend you join our [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/GkUNhZmenn) if you are looking to contribute, because you can talk with the developers of this project, and get feedback on potential pull requests before starting to work on them.

Upon finding a topic, feel free to get started coding it! When you are done, please thoroughly test this on your own bot. Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/yogurtsyum/qbot/compare)!
